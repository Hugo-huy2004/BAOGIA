 * and holds its frame at the top of the screen while it fades in, so its
 * opening plays over the previous film's closing instead of sliding in after
 * it. A film that `leaves` finishes its own timeline half-way through that
 * hand-over, so its last scene is still moving underneath.
 *
 * `height` is the film wrapper's height in svh. `progress` runs 0–1 over the
 * film's own scenes; spread `frame` onto the sticky frame's `style`.
